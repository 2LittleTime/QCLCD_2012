QCLCD Monthly Zip Archive Files For 2012
*******************

By request, I am publishing some of the QCLCD zip archive folders for 2012 as they are currently (20131004) unavailable due to the government shutdown.

I you are a Visual Studio person, feel free to grab the ZipArchiveExtractor solution from the repo in this same spot.  It was a handy way to extract the files I wanted without going through all the manual labor.  It might work for you as well.
